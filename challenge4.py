# Challenge 4
#
# You need to create a function called 'get_number_of_unique_characters' which will accept a string as a parameter (argument) e.g. message
# You need to return the number of characters that are unique in the string (message)
# By default if nothing is returned a function will return 'None'

# Add your function definition here:



# Tests around your function are below:

check_that_these_are_equal(
  get_number_of_unique_characters("abcde aaemm fg 113229"),
  13
)
